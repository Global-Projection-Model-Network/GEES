# Tariffs


## Assembly of Non-Commodity Imports

Production process has several stages (as mentioned in the *Production chapter*). The initial stage is an assembly of non-commodity imports that flow into the country. The aggregated function has a time-varying elasticity of substitution. Specifically, we assume a very low elasticity of substitution in the short run, but a unit elasticity of substitution in the long run.

Production function for assembling the imports
$$
mm_t = F(mm_t^1,\ \dots,\ mm_t^K)
$$

Imports in a country $mm_t$ are assembled from the goods originating in the remaining $K$ regions of the world (such as $mm^{1}_t$...$mm^K_t$), with certain weights calibrated based on population size, trade patterns etc. The technology choice decides how the imports are assembled.

Demand for imports, ignoring adjustment costs, is defined as
$$
\frac{mm_t^k}{mm_t}\ \propto\ \left( \frac{\frac{e_t}{e_t^k} \ pxx_t^k}{pmm_t} \right)^{-1}
$$

where $pxx^{k}_t$ is a price from the region $K$ quoted in country's currency and $pmm_t$ is a marginal cost of assembling the imports. Proportions of imports from individual areas/countries are price elastic.

## Import Tariffs

The model accounts for area/country-specific tariffs. The overall tariffs on imports from area $K$ consist of a common component applied across all regions $trm$ and and area/country-specific component $trm^{k}$.  The impact of the area/country-specific tariffs depends on the size of area/country.

Demand for imports with tariffs
$$
\frac{mm_t^k}{mm_t}\ \propto\ \left[ \frac{pmm_t^{\mathrm{fob}, k}\ (1 + trm_t + trm_t^k) }{pmm_t} \right]^{-1}
$$

Import price FOB destination 

$$
pmm_t^{\mathrm{fob}, k} = \frac{e_t}{e_t^k} \ pxx_t^k
$$

(Final) import price including tariffs

$$
pmm_t^{k} = \frac{e_t}{e_t^k} \ pxx_t^k \ (1 + trm_t + trm_t^k)
$$

## Import Price Indicators

Price | Where placed in the model
---|---
$pmm_t^{\mathrm{fob}, k}$ |  Balance of payments
$pmm_t^{k}$ | Input price facing local agents
$pmm_t^{\mathrm{fob}, k}-pmm_t^k$ |  Government revenues
