# What Are We Developing?

* A **modular framework** rather than a single model
  * Modular framework allows for a great flexibility to extend/shrink the model according to user's needs and preferences
  * Various modules (sectors) can be added/removed
  * It is a multi-country framework, which allows simply to add/delete some regions

* **GEES Scenario builder** is based on a DSGE core
  * Covers a wide spectrum of real and financial economy aspects, less emphasis on deep disaggregation (top-down framework)
  * Some pragmatic features are applied, if needed
  * Easy to operate and possible to include judgmental adjustments

# Current Stage

* Work in progress, under continuous development
* Robust core engine is available and allows to build a number of prototypes (e.g. multi-country, closed economy)
