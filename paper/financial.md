# Local Financial Sector

The local financial sector holds net claims (net positions) on three sectors, all in the form of debt (i.e. non-equity) instruments:

* the local representative household, $bh_t$,
* the local government, $bg_t$,
* the rest of the world, $bf_t$. 

Furthermore, we denote the value (net worth) of the local financial sector by $bb_t$; this value is part of the net worth of the local household (who are the ultimate owners of the local financial sector). The balance sheet identity (defining effectively the net worth of the financial sector) is  given by

$$
bb_t \equiv bh_t + bg_t + bf_t
$$

Any of the net balances occurring in this equation can take a positive or a negative value. A positive value of $bh_t$, $bg_t$ or $bf_t$ means a positive net asset position (net claim) on the respective sector, and vice versa.



The period profit or loss of the local financial sector, $\Pi_{b,t}$, is given by the sum of the net interest receivables/payables

$$
\Pi_{b,t} = rh_{t-1} \, bh_{t-1} + rg_{t-1} \, bg_{t-1} + rf_{t-1}\, bf_{t-1}
$$

This profit/loss is transferred to the local household budget every period.
