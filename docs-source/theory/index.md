# :fontawesome-solid-book-skull: Theoretical foundations

## What are we developing?

* A flexible, modular framework rather than a single, set-in-stone model

* Practical scenario builder based on DSGE foundations

* Emphasis on integrating a range of real and financial economy aspects,
  not on deep sectoral disaggregation

* Pragmatic features to introduce real-world regularities

* Balanced growth path

* Ease of operation and judgmental adjustments



## Current stage

* Work in progress, under continuous development

* Robust core engine

* A number of prototypes

* Would like to hear feedback about the GPMN member preferences
