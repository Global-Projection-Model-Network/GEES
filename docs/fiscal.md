* Government debt placed locally

* Lump-sum taxes

* Crowding-in in the short run

* Crowding-out in the long run

## Fiscal Budget Constraing

$$
dg_t = rg_{t-1} \cdot dg_{t-1}
+ pcg_t \cdot cg_t + pig_t \cdot ig_t
- trl1_t - trl2_t
$$

---

## Public Capital

$$
kg_t = (1-\delta) \ kg_{t-1} + ig_t
$$

Target level for public capital

$$
kg_t^\mathrm{tar} = \psi \cdot kh_t
$$

Investment rule
$$
\Delta \log ig_t = \log \kappa_{ig} + \tau_{ig} \left( \log 
kg_t - kg_t^\mathrm{tar} \right) \\[10pt]
\kappa_{ig} = \frac{ig\ss}{ig\ssm}
$$

## Government Consumption and Taxes

* Stabilizing mechanism to keep debt at a target level as a ratio to
  nominal GDP

$$
\frac{dg_t}{ngdp_t}
$$

* A wide range of mechanisms to stabilize debt
