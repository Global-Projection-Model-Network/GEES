The household enteres a net position in debt instruments (e.g. loans, deposits, fixed-income securities, etc.) with the local financial sector, $bh_t$, and holds a portfolio of claims on production capital in all areas (including the local area), $\\tsum_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t}\\, pk^a_t \\, k^a_t$; the latter is our way to mimic corporate equity holdings with cross-border exposures. During each period, the household purchases consumption goods, $ch_t$, supplies per-worker hours worked, $nh_t$, rents production capital, $k^a_t$, out to producers in the respective area, chooses the utilization rate of local production capital, $u_t$, invests in creating addition local capital, $i_t$, pays lump-sum taxes (or receives lump-sum transfers) of two types, $txls1_t$ and $txls2_t$, and collects period profits from local producers, local exporters, and the local financial sectors (of whom all the household is the ultimate owner). The household chooses the following quantities total consumption, $ch_t$, per-capita hours worked, $nh_t$, shares of claims on production capital possibly from all areas, $s_{a,t}\\in[0,\\,1]$, $a\\in A$, the utilization rate of local production capital, $u_t$, investment in local production capital, $i_t$, net financial position with the local financial sector, $bh_t$, to maximize its infinite lifetime utility function subject to a dynamic budget constaint. The household derives utility from consumption, disutility from work, and utility from its wealth (net worth). Household preferences The household preferences are described by a time-separable utility function over an infinite life horizon, $t=0,\\dots,\\infty$. The period utility function consists of a consumption utility component, $\\bU^{ch}_t$, a work disutility component, $\\bU^{nh}_t$, and a current wealth (net worth) utility component, $\\bU^{netw}_t$. The individual utility function components are each evaluated on a per-capita basis, and the overall period utility is multiplied by the total number of household members $$ \\begin{equation} \\E_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t \\Bigl( \\bU^{ch}_t - \\bU^{nh}_t + \\bU^{netw}_t \\Bigr)\\, nn_t \\end{equation} $$ The respective components of the utility function related to consumption, work and wealth, respectively, are given as follows $$ \\newcommand{\\Uch}{\\kappa_{ch}\\, \\blog \\frac{ch_t - \\extern{ch}_t^\\ref}{nn_t}} \\bU^{ch}_t \\equiv \\Uch $$ $$ \\newcommand{\\Unh}{\\frac{1}{1+\\eta}\\ nh_t{}^{1+\\eta}} \\bU^{nh}_t \\equiv \\Unh $$ $$ \\newcommand{\\Unetw}{\\nu_1 \\left( \\blog \\frac{netw_t}{pc_t\\, \\extern{ch}_t} - \\nu_0 \\frac{netw_t}{pc_t\\, \\extern{ch}_t}\\right) } \\bU^{netw}_t \\equiv \\Unetw $$ where $ch_t^\\ref$ is the reference point in household consumption proportional to the level of real current labor income net of type 1 lump-sum taxes (or transfers) and externalized from the household optimization $$ ch_t^\\ref \\equiv \\chi \\, \\frac{curr_t}{pc_t} $$ $\\kappa_{ch} \\equiv 1 - ch^\\ref_\\ss\\, ch_\\ss{}^{-1}$ is a steady-state correction constant ensuring that the marginal utility of consumption equals $nn_t \\, ch_\\ss{}^{-1}$ in steady state, a feature of modeling convenience, $curr_t$ is current labor income net of type 1 lump sum taxes (or transfers) $$ curr_t \\equiv w_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t - txls1_t $$ $netw_t$ is the nominal net worth given by the sum of the value of the production capital portfolio, the net financial position of the household to the local financial sector, $bh_t$ (a positive balance means net claims of the financial sector on the household), and the net worth of the local financial sector (whose ultimate owner the household is), $bb_t$, $$ netw_t \\equiv \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{a,t} \\, k_{a,t} - bh_t + bb_t $$ $ex_{a,t}$ is the cross rate between local currency and area $a$'s currency (with movements up meaning depreciation of local currency) $$ ex_{a,t} = \\frac{e_{\\local, t}}{e_{a,t}}, \\quad ex_{\\local,t}=1 $$ Dynamic budget constraint The dynamic budget constraint facing the household sector describes a stock-flow relationship between the household assets and liabilities (stocks) on the one hand, and current receipts and current outlays (flows) on the other hand. The household assets and liabilities consist of a net position with the local financial sector, $-bh_t$ (a positive balance means net lending by the household from the financial sector, a negative balance means net lending by the financial sector from the household), claims on production capital (local and ccross-border capital), $\\sum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t}\\, pk_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a$, and The change in the household assets and liabilities is equal to the revaluation of capital claims, and the total amount of current receipts and outlays: revaluation of claims on production capital (both from the nominal exchange rate and the capital price), $\\sum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t-1} \\, \\bDelta!\\left( ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{t}^a \\right) \\, k_{t-1}^a$, interest receipts or outlays on the net position with the local financial sector, $\\left( rh_{t-1} -1 \\right) bh_{t-1}$ current receipts from capital rentals net of capital utilization costs, $\\sum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\,ex_{a,t}\\, pu_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a - \\Xi_{u,t}$, current receipts from labor income, $w_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t$, current receipts from selling newly installed capital, $pk_t\\,i_t$, profits from loccal producers, $\\Pi_{y,t}$, exporters, $\\Pi_{x,t}$, and the financial sector, $\\Pi_{b,t}$, current outlays on consumption goods, $-pc_t \\, ch_t$, current outlays on investment goods, $-pi_t \\, i_t$, $$ \\begin{gathered} \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a - bh_t \\ \\cdots \\newl =\\ \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t-1}\\, ex_{a,t} \\Bigl[ pu_{t}^a \\, u^a_t + \\left(1-\\delta^a\\right) pk^a_{t} \\Bigr] k^a_{t-1} - rh_{t-1} bh_{t-1} \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ w_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t - pc_t \\, ch_t + \\left(pk_t - pi_t\\right) i_t - txls1_t - txls2_t \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ \\bPi_{y,t} + \\bPi_{x,t} + \\bPi_{b,t} - \\Xi_{i,t} - \\Xi_{k,t} - \\Xi_{u,t} + \\extern{\\Xi}_{h,t} \\end{gathered} $$ Lagrange multiplier associated with the budget constraint is denoted by $vh_t$ (shadow value of nominal household wealth) Real wage rigidities The labor market exhibits real wage rigidities. These rigidities do not derive from explicit microfoundations in our model; they are introduced as an ad-hoc correction to the law of motion for the real wage rate in the following way. The household makes its choices as though the wage rate was fully flexible; we denote this hypothetical level of the nominal wage rate by $ww_t$, and use this hypothetical wage in the household Lagrangian, in place of the actual wage rate. Once the hypothetical flexible optimum wage rate is determined, the actual wage rate follows an autoregressive process with asymptotic convergence to the flexible optimum $$ \\blog \\frac{w_t}{pc_t} = \\rho_{w} \\ \\blog \\frac{\\kappa_w\\, w_{t-1}}{pc_{t-1}} + \\left(1-\\rho_w\\right) \\ \\blog \\frac{ww_t}{pc_t} + \\epsilon_{w,t} $$ where the past real wage is indexed by a steady-state adjustment constant, $\\kappa_w$, given by the gross rate of change in the steady-state real wage rate $$ \\kappa_w \\equiv \\roc{w} \\ss \\ \\roc{pc} \\ss{}^{-1} $$ and $\\rho_w\\in[0,\\,1)$ is an autoregression parameter. Costs of short-term adjustment processes The optimizing behavior of the representative household is subjected to two types of costly short-term adjustment processes: an investment adjustment/installation cost a capital utilization cost. The investment adjustment/installation cost comprises two components: departures from a steady-state investment-to-capital ratio, and departures from a steady-state rate of change in investment $$ \\Xi_{i,t} \\equiv \\tfrac{1}{2} \\, \\xi_{i1} \\, pi_t \\, \\extern{i} t \\, \\Bigl( \\blog i_t - \\blog \\extern{i}^\\ref_t \\Bigr)^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\, \\xi {i2} \\, pi_t \\, \\extern{i} t \\, \\Bigl( \\mathbf{\\Delta log\\ } i_t - \\blog \\kappa {i} \\Bigr)^2 \\[5pt] $$ where $i^\\ref_t$ is a point of reference derived from the steady-state investment-to-capital ratio applied to the stock of capital last period, $$ i^\\ref_t \\equiv \\frac{i_\\ss}{k_\\ss} \\, k_{t-1} \\, \\roc{\\imath}_\\ss $$ and $\\kappa_{i} \\equiv \\roc{\\imath}_\\ss$ is a steady-state adjustment constant ensuring that the cost term disappears in steady-state. The cost of capital utilization give rise to a cyclical response in the rate of utilization of the existing stock of capital. The cost function is given by $$ \\Xi_{u,t} \\equiv s_{\\local,t} \\, py_t \\, k_t \\, \\frac{\\upsilon_0}{1+\\upsilon_1} \\, u_t{}^{1+\\upsilon_1} $$ Capital accumulation The household purchases investment goods, converts them to newly installed production capital (paying the adjustment/installation cost in the process) and adds these to the existing stock of capital $$ k_t = (1-\\delta)\\ k_{t-1} + i_t $$ Lagragian for the household optimization problem The Lagrangian for the contrained optimization problem facing the representative household consists of the lifetime utility function and a sequence of dynamic budget constraints for each time from now until infinity, $t=0, \\dots, \\infty$. Note that we use $ww_t$ in place of $w_t$ in the Lagrangian. $$ \\bmax_{{ch_t, bh_t, s_{a,t}, i_{t}, nh_t, u_t }} \\newl \\begin{multline} \\sum\\nolimits_{t} \\beta^t \\Bigl[ \\Uch + \\Unh + \\Unetw \\Bigr] \\, nn_t \\ \\cdots \\newl +\\ \\sum\\nolimits_t \\beta^t vh_t\\, \\Bigl{ - \\tsum\\nolimits_{a} s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a + bh_t \\Bigr. \\ \\cdots \\newl +\\ \\tsum\\nolimits_{a} s_{a,t-1}\\, ex_{a,t} \\Bigl[ pu_{t}^a \\, u^a_t + \\left(1-\\delta^a\\right) pk^a_{t} \\Bigr] k^a_{t-1} - rh_{t-1} bh_{t-1} \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ ww_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t - pc_t \\, ch_t + \\left(pk_t - pi_t\\right) i_t - txls1_t - txls2_t \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\bPi_{y,t} + \\bPi_{x,t} + \\bPi_{b,t} -\\ \\Xi_{i,t} - \\Xi_{k,t} - \\Xi_{u,t} + \\extern{\\Xi}_{h,t} \\Bigr. \\Bigr} \\end{multline} $$ where $vh_t$ is the Lagrange multiplier on time-$t$ budget constraint. Optimality conditions The optimal (utility maximizing) choices of the representative household are described by the following first-order conditions. Consumption, $ch_t$ $$ vh_t \\, ph_t = \\kappa_{ch}\\, \\frac{1}{ch_t - \\extern{ch}^\\ref_t} \\, nn_t $$ Per-worker hours worked depending on the hypothetical flexible wage rate, $ww_t$ $$ vh_t \\, ww_t = nh_t{}^\\eta $$ Net position with the financial sector, $bh_t$ (an intertemporal no-arbitrage condition) $$ vh_t = \\beta \\, vh_{t+1} \\, rh_t + \\nu_1 \\frac{1}{pc_t \\, \\extern{ch}_t} \\left( \\frac{pc_t \\, \\extern{ch}_t}{netw_t} - \\nu_0 \\right) $$ Utilization rate of production capital, $u_t$ $$ \\upsilon_0 \\, u_t{}^{\\upsilon_1} \\, py_t = pu_t $$ Investment in local production capital, $i_t$ $$ pk_t = pi_t \\Bigl[ 1 + \\xi_{i1} \\bigl( \\blog i_t - \\blog \\extern{i}^\\ref_t \\bigr) + \\xi_{i2} \\bigl(\\bDelta \\blog i_t - \\kappa_i\\bigr) - \\xi_{i2} \\, \\beta\\, \\bigl(\\bDelta \\blog i_{t+1} - \\kappa_i\\bigr) \\Bigr] $$ Claims on area $a$'s production capital, $s_{a,t}$ $$ vh_t \\, pk^a_t = vh_t \\, pu^a_t \\, u^a_t + \\beta \\, vh_{t+1} \\left(1-\\delta^a\\right) pk_{t+1}, \\quad \\forall a \\in A $$ The last set of equations defines arbitrage-free conditions (AFCs) for a corporate equity portfolio choice. We need to further address the following two characteristics of these NACs: As is common in macro models, the AFCs themselves do not determine the actual portfolio shares, $s_{a,t}$, only the relationship between the price of production capital, the cash flows it generates, and the houseshold discount factor. The actual shares are then calibrated and kept fixed in the baseline version of the model. Since we allow for cross-border holdings, each area's capital is subject to muliple AFCs, each relating to the household residing in a different area and exhibiting, in general, different preferences. We therefore create aggregate AFCs by taking the weighted average with the weights equal the portfolio shares. The aggregate AFCs for the capital markets are described in the Global equilibrium section.

The actual shares are then calibrated and kept fixed in the baseline version of the model. Since we allow for cross-border holdings, each area's capital is subject to muliple AFCs, each relating to the household residing in a different area and exhibiting, in general, different preferences.

Introduction Each area's household sector is modeled as a single representative household with an exogenous time-varying number of household members, $nn_t$. The household enteres a net position in debt instruments (e.g. loans, deposits, fixed-income securities, etc.) with the local financial sector, $bh_t$, and holds a portfolio of claims on production capital in all areas (including the local area), $\\tsum_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t}\\, pk^a_t \\, k^a_t$; the latter is our way to mimic corporate equity holdings with cross-border exposures. During each period, the household purchases consumption goods, $ch_t$, supplies per-worker hours worked, $nh_t$, rents production capital, $k^a_t$, out to producers in the respective area, chooses the utilization rate of local production capital, $u_t$, invests in creating addition local capital, $i_t$, pays lump-sum taxes (or receives lump-sum transfers) of two types, $txls1_t$ and $txls2_t$, and collects period profits from local producers, local exporters, and the local financial sectors (of whom all the household is the ultimate owner). The household chooses the following quantities total consumption, $ch_t$, per-capita hours worked, $nh_t$, shares of claims on production capital possibly from all areas, $s_{a,t}\\in[0,\\,1]$, $a\\in A$, the utilization rate of local production capital, $u_t$, investment in local production capital, $i_t$, net financial position with the local financial sector, $bh_t$, to maximize its infinite lifetime utility function subject to a dynamic budget constaint. The household derives utility from consumption, disutility from work, and utility from its wealth (net worth). Household preferences The household preferences are described by a time-separable utility function over an infinite life horizon, $t=0,\\dots,\\infty$. The period utility function consists of a consumption utility component, $\\bU^{ch}_t$, a work disutility component, $\\bU^{nh}_t$, and a current wealth (net worth) utility component, $\\bU^{netw}_t$. The individual utility function components are each evaluated on a per-capita basis, and the overall period utility is multiplied by the total number of household members $$ \\begin{equation} \\E_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t \\Bigl( \\bU^{ch}_t - \\bU^{nh}_t + \\bU^{netw}_t \\Bigr)\\, nn_t \\end{equation} $$ The respective components of the utility function related to consumption, work and wealth, respectively, are given as follows $$ \\newcommand{\\Uch}{\\kappa_{ch}\\, \\blog \\frac{ch_t - \\extern{ch}_t^\\ref}{nn_t}} \\bU^{ch}_t \\equiv \\Uch $$ $$ \\newcommand{\\Unh}{\\frac{1}{1+\\eta}\\ nh_t{}^{1+\\eta}} \\bU^{nh}_t \\equiv \\Unh $$ $$ \\newcommand{\\Unetw}{\\nu_1 \\left( \\blog \\frac{netw_t}{pc_t\\, \\extern{ch}_t} - \\nu_0 \\frac{netw_t}{pc_t\\, \\extern{ch}_t}\\right) } \\bU^{netw}_t \\equiv \\Unetw $$ where $ch_t^\\ref$ is the reference point in household consumption proportional to the level of real current labor income net of type 1 lump-sum taxes (or transfers) and externalized from the household optimization $$ ch_t^\\ref \\equiv \\chi_{curr} \\, \\frac{curr_t}{pc_t} + \\chi_c \\, c_{t-1} $$ $\\kappa_{ch} \\equiv 1 - ch^\\ref_\\ss\\, ch_\\ss{}^{-1}$ is a steady-state correction constant ensuring that the marginal utility of consumption equals $nn_t \\, ch_\\ss{}^{-1}$ in steady state, a feature of modeling convenience, $curr_t$ is current labor income net of type 1 lump sum taxes (or transfers) $$ curr_t \\equiv w_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t - txls1_t $$ $netw_t$ is the nominal net worth given by the sum of the value of the production capital portfolio, the net financial position of the household to the local financial sector, $bh_t$ (a positive balance means net claims of the financial sector on the household), and the net worth of the local financial sector (whose ultimate owner the household is), $bb_t$, $$ netw_t \\equiv \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{a,t} \\, k_{a,t} - bh_t + bb_t $$ $ex_{a,t}$ is the cross rate between local currency and area $a$'s currency (with movements up meaning depreciation of local currency) $$ ex_{a,t} = \\frac{e_{\\local, t}}{e_{a,t}}, \\quad ex_{\\local,t}=1 $$ Dynamic budget constraint The dynamic budget constraint facing the household sector describes a stock-flow relationship between the household assets and liabilities (stocks) on the one hand, and current receipts and current outlays (flows) on the other hand. The household assets and liabilities consist of a net position with the local financial sector, $-bh_t$ (a positive balance means net lending by the household from the financial sector, a negative balance means net lending by the financial sector from the household), claims on production capital (local and ccross-border capital), $\\sum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t}\\, pk_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a$, and The change in the household assets and liabilities is equal to the revaluation of capital claims, and the total amount of current receipts and outlays: revaluation of claims on production capital (both from the nominal exchange rate and the capital price), $\\sum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t-1} \\, \\bDelta!\\left( ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{t}^a \\right) \\, k_{t-1}^a$, interest receipts or outlays on the net position with the local financial sector, $\\left( rh_{t-1} -1 \\right) bh_{t-1}$ current receipts from capital rentals net of capital utilization costs, $\\sum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\,ex_{a,t}\\, pu_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a - \\Xi_{u,t}$, current receipts from labor income, $w_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t$, current receipts from selling newly installed capital, $pk_t\\,i_t$, profits from loccal producers, $\\Pi_{y,t}$, exporters, $\\Pi_{x,t}$, and the financial sector, $\\Pi_{b,t}$, current outlays on consumption goods, $-pc_t \\, ch_t$, current outlays on investment goods, $-pi_t \\, i_t$, $$ \\begin{gathered} \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a - bh_t \\ \\cdots \\newl =\\ \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t-1}\\, ex_{a,t} \\left(1-\\delta^a\\right) pk^a_{t}\\, k^a_{t-1} - bh_{t-1} \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t}\\, ex_{a,t} \\, pu_{t}^a \\, u^a_t k^a_{t} - \\left(rh_{t-1} - 1\\right) bh_{t-1} \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ w_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t - pc_t \\, ch_t + \\left(pk_t - pi_t\\right) i_t - txls1_t - txls2_t \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ \\bPi_{y,t} + \\bPi_{x,t} + \\bPi_{b,t} - \\Xi_{i,t} - \\Xi_{k,t} - \\Xi_{u,t} + \\extern{\\Xi}_{h,t} \\end{gathered} $$ Lagrange multiplier associated with the budget constraint is denoted by $vh_t$ (shadow value of nominal household wealth) Real wage rigidities The labor market exhibits real wage rigidities. These rigidities do not derive from explicit microfoundations in our model; they are introduced as an ad-hoc correction to the law of motion for the real wage rate in the following way. The household makes its choices as though the wage rate was fully flexible; we denote this hypothetical level of the nominal wage rate by $ww_t$, and use this hypothetical wage in the household Lagrangian, in place of the actual wage rate. Once the hypothetical flexible optimum wage rate is determined, the actual wage rate follows an autoregressive process with asymptotic convergence to the flexible optimum $$ \\blog \\frac{w_t}{pc_t} = \\rho_{w} \\ \\blog \\frac{\\kappa_w\\, w_{t-1}}{pc_{t-1}} + \\left(1-\\rho_w\\right) \\ \\blog \\frac{ww_t}{pc_t} + \\epsilon_{w,t} $$ where the past real wage is indexed by a steady-state adjustment constant, $\\kappa_w$, given by the gross rate of change in the steady-state real wage rate $$ \\kappa_w \\equiv \\roc{w} \\ss \\ \\roc{pc} \\ss{}^{-1} $$ and $\\rho_w\\in[0,\\,1)$ is an autoregression parameter. Short-term adjustment costs The optimizing behavior of the representative household is subjected to two types of costly short-term adjustment processes: an investment adjustment/installation cost a capital utilization cost. The investment adjustment/installation cost comprises two components: departures from a steady-state investment-to-capital ratio, and departures from a steady-state rate of change in investment $$ \\Xi_{i,t} \\equiv \\tfrac{1}{2} \\, \\xi_{i1} \\, pi_t \\, \\extern{i} t \\, \\Bigl( \\blog i_t - \\blog \\extern{i}^\\ref_t \\Bigr)^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\, \\xi {i2} \\, pi_t \\, \\extern{i} t \\, \\Bigl( \\mathbf{\\Delta log\\ } i_t - \\blog \\kappa {i} \\Bigr)^2 \\[5pt] $$ where $i^\\ref_t$ is a point of reference derived from the steady-state investment-to-capital ratio applied to the stock of capital last period, $$ i^\\ref_t \\equiv \\frac{i_\\ss}{k_\\ss} \\, k_{t-1} \\, \\roc{\\imath}_\\ss $$ and $\\kappa_{i} \\equiv \\roc{\\imath}_\\ss$ is a steady-state adjustment constant ensuring that the cost term disappears in steady-state. The cost of capital utilization give rise to a cyclical response in the rate of utilization of the existing stock of capital. The cost function is given by $$ \\Xi_{u,t} \\equiv s_{\\local,t} \\, py_t \\, k_t \\, \\frac{\\upsilon_0}{1+\\upsilon_1} \\, u_t{}^{1+\\upsilon_1} $$ Capital accumulation The household purchases investment goods, converts them to newly installed production capital (paying the adjustment/installation cost in the process) and adds these to the existing stock of capital $$ k_t = (1-\\delta)\\ k_{t-1} + i_t $$ Lagragian The Lagrangian for the contrained optimization problem facing the representative household consists of the lifetime utility function and a sequence of dynamic budget constraints for each time from now until infinity, $t=0, \\dots, \\infty$. Note that we use $ww_t$ in place of $w_t$ in the Lagrangian. $$ \\begin{gathered} \\bmax_{{ch_t, bh_t, s_{a,t}, i_{t}, nh_t, u_t }} \\newl \\sum\\nolimits_{t} \\beta^t \\Bigl[ \\Uch + \\Unh + \\Unetw \\Bigr] \\, nn_t \\ \\cdots \\end{gathered} $$ $$ \\begin{multline} +\\ \\sum\\nolimits_t \\beta^t vh_t\\, \\Bigl{ - \\tsum\\nolimits_{a} s_{a,t} \\, ex_{a,t} \\, pk_{t}^a \\, k_{t}^a + bh_t \\Bigr. \\ \\cdots \\newl +\\ \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t-1}\\, ex_{a,t} \\left(1-\\delta^a\\right) pk^a_{t}\\, k^a_{t-1} - bh_{t-1} \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ \\left(\\betak_{t-1}{}\\right)^t \\tsum\\nolimits_a s_{a,t}\\, ex_{a,t} \\, pu_{t}^a \\, u^a_t k^a_{t} - \\left(rh_{t-1} - 1\\right) bh_{t-1} \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\ ww_t \\, nh_t \\, nl_t - pc_t \\, ch_t + \\left(pk_t - pi_t\\right) i_t - txls1_t - txls2_t . \\ \\cdots \\newl + \\bPi_{y,t} + \\bPi_{x,t} + \\bPi_{b,t} -\\ \\Xi_{i,t} - \\Xi_{k,t} - \\Xi_{u,t} + \\extern{\\Xi}_{h,t} \\Bigr. \\Bigr} \\end{multline} $$ where $vh_t$ is the Lagrange multiplier on time-$t$ budget constraint, and $\\betak$ is the additional discount factor applied to the value of corporate equity holdings to compensate for the risk aversion of households. Optimality conditions The optimal (utility maximizing) choices of the representative household are described by the following first-order conditions. Consumption, $ch_t$ $$ vh_t \\, ph_t = \\kappa_{ch}\\, \\frac{1}{ch_t - \\extern{ch}^\\ref_t} \\, nn_t $$ Per-worker hours worked depending on the hypothetical flexible wage rate, $ww_t$ $$ vh_t \\, ww_t = nh_t{}^\\eta $$ Net position with the financial sector, $bh_t$ (an intertemporal no-arbitrage condition) $$ vh_t = \\beta \\, vh_{t+1} \\, rh_t + \\nu_1 \\frac{1}{pc_t \\, \\extern{ch}_t} \\left( \\frac{pc_t \\, \\extern{ch}_t}{netw_t} - \\nu_0 \\right) $$ Utilization rate of production capital, $u_t$ $$ \\upsilon_0 \\, u_t{}^{\\upsilon_1} \\, py_t = pu_t $$ Investment in local production capital, $i_t$ $$ pk_t = pi_t \\Bigl[ 1 + \\xi_{i1} \\bigl( \\blog i_t - \\blog \\extern{i}^\\ref_t \\bigr) + \\xi_{i2} \\bigl(\\bDelta \\blog i_t - \\kappa_i\\bigr) - \\xi_{i2} \\, \\beta\\, zk_t \\, \\bigl(\\bDelta \\blog i_{t+1} - \\kappa_i\\bigr) \\Bigr] $$ Claims on area $a$'s production capital, $s_{a,t}$, $\\forall a \\in A$ $$ \\beta \\, vh_{t+1} \\, rh_t \\, pk^a_t \\, ex_t^a = vh_t \\, pu^a_t \\, ex_t^a \\, u^a_t + \\beta \\, \\betak_{t} \\, vh_{t+1} \\left(1-\\delta^a\\right) pk^a_{t+1}\\, ex_{t+1}^a $$ The last set of equations defines arbitrage-free conditions (AFCs) for a corporate equity portfolio choice. We need to further address the following two characteristics of these NACs: As is common in macro models, the AFCs themselves do not determine the actual portfolio shares, $s_{a,t}$, only the relationship between the price of production capital, the cash flows it generates, and the houseshold discount factor. The actual shares are then calibrated and kept fixed in the baseline version of the model. Since we allow for cross-border holdings, each area's capital is subject to muliple AFCs, each relating to the household residing in a different area and exhibiting, in general, different preferences. We therefore create aggregate AFCs by taking the weighted average with the weights equal the portfolio shares. The aggregate AFCs for the capital markets are described in the Global equilibrium section.","title":"Households"},{"location":"theory/households.html#fontawesome-solid-house-households","text":"--8<-- \"docs-source/theory/math.md\"","title":":fontawesome-solid-house: Households"},{"location":"theory/households.html#introduction","text":"Each area's household sector is modeled as a single representative household with an exogenous time-varying number of household members, $nn_t$.

We need to further address the following two characteristics of these NACs: As is common in macro models, the AFCs themselves do not determine the actual portfolio shares, $s_{a,t}$, only the relationship between the price of production capital, the cash flows it generates, and the houseshold discount factor. The actual shares are then calibrated and kept fixed in the baseline version of the model. Since we allow for cross-border holdings, each area's capital is subject to muliple AFCs, each relating to the household residing in a different area and exhibiting, in general, different preferences. We therefore create aggregate AFCs by taking the weighted average with the weights equal the portfolio shares. The aggregate AFCs for the capital markets are described in the Global equilibrium section.","title":"Optimality conditions"},{"location":"theory/math.html","text":"$$ \\newcommand{\\tsum}{\\textstyle\\sum} \\newcommand{\\extern}[1]{\\mathrm{\\mathbf{{#1}}}} \\newcommand{\\local}{\\mathrm{local}} \\newcommand{\\roc}[1]{\\overset{\\scriptsize\\Delta}{#1{}}} \\newcommand{\\ss}{\\mathrm{ss}} \\newcommand{\\E}{\\mathbf{E}} \\newcommand{\\ref}{{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\newcommand{\\blog}{\\mathbf{log}\\ } \\newcommand{\\bmax}{\\mathbf{max}\\ } \\newcommand{\\bDelta}{\\mathbf{\\Delta}} \\newcommand{\\bPi}{\\mathbf{\\Pi}} \\newcommand{\\bU}{\\mathbf{U}} \\newcommand{\\newl}{\\\\[8pt]} \\newcommand{\\betak}{\\mathit{zk}} \\newcommand{\\betay}{\\mathit{zy}} \\notag $$ { .math-definitions }","title":"Math"},{"location":"theory/monetary.html","text":"Monetary Policy Inflation targeting reaction function Exchange rate peg Inflation targeting with exchange rate management","title":"Monetary Policy"},{"location":"theory/monetary.html#monetary-policy","text":"Inflation targeting reaction function Exchange rate peg Inflation targeting with exchange rate management","title":"Monetary Policy"},{"location":"theory/nonlinear.html","text":"Nonlinear Simulations System of Nonlinear Equations with Model-Consistent Expectations $$ \\newcommand{\\Et}{\\mathrm{E} t} \\Et \\left[ f_1\\left( x {t-1}, x_t, x_{t+1}, \\epsilon_t \\ \\middle| \\ \\theta \\right) \\right] = 0 \\[10pt] \\vdots \\[10pt] \\Et \\left[ f_k\\left( x_{t-1}, x_t, x_{t+1}, \\epsilon_t \\ \\middle| \\ \\theta \\right) \\right] = 0 \\[40pt] \\mathrm E \\ \\epsilon_t \\epsilon_t' = \\Omega $$ Methods for Nonlinear Simulations Characteristics Local Approximation Global Approximation Stacked Time Solution form Function Function Sequence of Numbers Terminal condition problem No No Yes Global nonlinearity No Yes Yes Stochastic uncertainty Yes Yes No Fully automated design Yes No Yes Large scale models Yes No Yes Local Approximation Deviations from non-stochastic steady state $$ \\hat x_t = x_t -
